# Game of Life

You can find the deployed project at [Game of Life](https://sjeremich23.github.io/Game-of-Life/)

## Overview

This was my project for Lambda School's Computer Science course build week 1. This project is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. It takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid in which cells can be ‘on’ (alive) or ‘off’ (dead), and is defined by a set of rules that jointly determine the state of a cell given the state of its neighbours. Following specification of an initial configuration, patterns evolve over time across the grid requiring no further user input.
